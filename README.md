# Automated-Movie-Review-Filtering-and-Classification
The objective of this research is to create a machine learning model that can automatically identify unfavorable movie reviews. The model must obtain a minimum F1 score of 0.85 using a dataset of IMDB reviews that are classified as both positive and negative. Exploratory analysis, loading and preparing the data, creating and assessing many categorization models, and comparing the outcomes are all steps in the process. We will investigate several machine learning techniques, including logistic regression and gradient boosting, to increase the classification accuracy of reviews.
